                              Perfitys plugin

The author has started writing the Perfitys Vim plugin to fulfill his personal
needs as a Vim user without cluttering his vimrc file with autocommands and
other settings. The plugin applies per file type settings and offers some
automatic typing fonctionalities.

The default behaviour of the plugin may not be suitable to every Vim users but
the plugin is extremely customizable and every default setting can be
overwritten by assigning specific variables in the vimrc file.

This plugin is a work in (slow) progress and new features may be added and
existing default settings modified.

The file type support is far from complete. Only a few file types are
supported. But support for other file types can easily be added.

==============================================================================
1. Installation

The Perfitys plugin comes with the following directory tree:

perfitys
        autoload
        doc
        ftplugin
        plugin

If you use Pathogen (a popular Vim plugin to manage Vim plugins), you just
have to place the whole tree in your bundle directory (on a Linux system, it
is probably ~/.vim/bundle). If you have Git installed and an internet access,
just issue this command in a terminal after moving to your bundle directory:

git clone git://github.com/thierr26/perfitys.git

Make sure that Pathogen and the filetype plugins are enabled in your vimrc
file with the following commands:

        call pathogen#infect()
        call pathogen#helptags()
        filetype plugin indent on


The author hasn't tested the other popular Vim plugin managers, but it should
be possible to do the installation in a similar way when using those plugins.

If you don't use a plugin manager, you have to manually copy the files. For
example, on a Linux system, the files in perfitys/autoload must be copied to
~/.vim/autoload. The files in perfitys/doc must be copied to ~/.vim/doc,
etc...

Whatever the way you have installed Perfitys, you have to make sure you have
enabled the filetype plugins in your vimrc file with the
"filetype plugin indent on" command.

==============================================================================
2. Supported file types

Currently, the following file types are supported:

ada
c
conf
css
gitcommit
haskell
help
html
php
sh
text
vim
xdefaults

==============================================================================
3. Disabling the plugin

You can completely disable the Perfitys plugin without uninstalling it by
adding this line to your vimrc file:

        let g:loaded_perfitys = 1




The file type specific scripts of Perfitys are not run if another filetype
plugin has already set the variable b:did_ftplugin.

If they are run, the Perfitys file type specific scripts set the variable
b:did_ftplugin, which causes other filetype plugins to be disabled. You can
prevent Perfitys from setting b:did_ftplugin by adding the following line to
your vimrc file:

        let g:perfitys_do_not_set_did_ftplugin = 1


If you want to prevent Perfitys from setting b:did_ftplugin for a specific
file type only (say the "sh" file type), add the following line to your vimrc
file:

        let g:perfitys_ada_do_not_set_did_ftplugin = 1


==============================================================================
4. Per file type settings

4.1. Text width


The 'textwidth' option is set by Perfitys depending on the file type. The
default settings are as follows:

| File type                        | 'textwidth' option value |
|----------------------------------+--------------------------|
| ada, c, conf, css, haskell, html | 79                       |
| gitcommit                        | 72                       |
| help, text                       | 78                       |
| php, sh, vim, xdefaults          | 79                       |

The default settings can be overwritten by setting global variables in your
vimrc file. For example, if you want a text width of 80 for the sh file type,
add the following line to your vimrc file:

        let g:perfitys_sh_textwidth = 80




If you don't want a per file type text width, but a common text width (say 80)
for all the supported file types, add the following line to your vimrc file:
>
        let g:perfitys_common_textwidth = 80




Perfitys also changes the 'colorcolumn' option. By default, it adds a value
which is the textwidth value plus two. If you prefer to highlight the column
next to text width, add the following line to your vimrc file:

        let g:perfitys_colorcolumn_relative_to_width = 1



Note that if the text width has been set to 0, then the 'colorcolumn' option
is not affected.

If you don't want Perfitys to affect the 'colorcolumn' option at all, add the
following line to your vimrc file:

        let g:perfitys_do_not_set_colorcolumn = 1


----------------------------------------------
4.2. Tab preferences


The 'tabstop', 'shiftwidth' and 'softtabstop' are set by Perfitys depending on
the file type. The default settings are as follows:

| File type     | 'tabstop', 'shiftwidth' and 'softtabstop' options value |
|---------------+---------------------------------------------------------|
| ada           | 3                                                       |
| c, conf, css  | 4                                                       |
| gitcommit     | 4                                                       |
| haskell, html | 4                                                       |
| php, sh, vim  | 4                                                       |
| help, text    | 8                                                       |
| xdefaults     | 4                                                       |

The default settings can be overwritten by setting global variables to your
vimrc file. For example, if you want a tab width of 8 for the sh file type,
add the following line to your vimrc file:

        let g:perfitys_sh_tabstop = 8




If you don't want a per file type tab width, but a common tab width (say 8)
for all the supported file types, add the following line to your vimrc file:

        let g:perfitys_common_tabstop = 8



By default, the 'expandtab' option is set to expandtab for all the supported
file types. If for a particular file type (say sh) you want the 'expandtab'
option set to noexpandtab, add the following line to your vimrc file:

        let g:perfitys_sh_expandtab = "noexpandtab"


Actually, the allowed values for such variables are "expandtab",
"noexpandtab", "et" and "noet", similarly to the 'expandtab' option.



If you want the 'expandtab' option to be set to noexpandtab for all the
supported file types, add the following line to your vimrc file:

        let g:perfitys_common_expandtab = "noexpandtab"


----------------------------------------------
4.3. Alternative file type


Perfitys provides a function to change the 'filetype' option for a buffer
(only if the 'filetype' option has been set). This function can be operated
using the :AltFileType command, or using the Plugin | Perfitys menu.

A key mapping is also defined: <Leader>FT

You can change this mapping (say to <Leader>ZZ) by adding the following line
to your |vimrc| file:

        map <Leader>ZZ <Plug>PerfitysAltFileType


With the default setting, the functions changes the 'filetype' option if the
'filetype' option is set to "help", "text", "php" or "html". If the 'filetype'
option has an other value, the function does not change it.

| When 'filetype' is set to | :AltFileType changes it to |
|---------------------------+----------------------------|
| help                      | text                       |
| text                      | help                       |
| html                      | php                        |
| php                       | html                       |


You can redefine the behaviour of the function by adding a line like the
following in your vimrc file:

let g:perfitys_alt_filetype = {'help': "text", 'php': "html"}


g:perfitys_alt_filetype is a dictionary variable defining pairs of filetype
values. If the 'filetype' option is in one of the pairs, then the function
changes the 'filetype' value to the other value of the pair. You can add all
the pairs you need.

----------------------------------------------
4.4. "End of line" comment

The Vim default value for the 'comments' option seems to be:

s1:/*,mb:*,ex:*/,://,b:#,:%,:XCOMM,n:>,fb:-

For the file types which support "end of line" comments, Perfitys adds the
associated comment leader to the 'comments' option (unless the comment leader
is already in the 'comments' option.

For exemple, for the ada file type, Perfitys changes the 'comments' option to:

s1:/*,mb:*,ex:*/,://,b:#,:%,:XCOMM,n:>,fb:-,b:--

(",b:--" has been appended to the 'comments' option).

----------------------------------------------
4.5. Bullet-lists

The Vim default value for the 'comments' option seems to be:

s1:/*,mb:*,ex:*/,://,b:#,:%,:XCOMM,n:>,fb:-

The "fb:-" means that "- " is considered to be a leader for a bullet-list
item (see format-comments). And this is applied for all file types.

The only action of Perfitys regarding bullet-lists is to set the 'comments'
option to "://,b:#,:%,:XCOMM,n:>,fb:-,fb:*" for the gitcommit file type. This
implies that for the gitcommit file type, both "- " and "* " are considered to
be leaders for bullet-list items.

==============================================================================
5. Automatic typing


5.1. Primary separator

Perfitys provides a function for inserting a separator line in the current
buffer. Well actually two functions, because the author has encountered the
need for two different kinds of separator lines in the same file.

Both kinds of separator lines are comment lines if the file type is of a
programming language supported by Perfitys.

One kind is said "primary separator", the other kind is said "secondary
separator".



A primary separator line can be inserted using the :Sep or :PrimSep commands,
or using the Plugin | Perfitys menu.

A key mapping is also defined: <Leader>SS

You can change this mapping (say to <Leader>ZZ) by adding the following line
to your vimrc file:

        map <Leader>ZZ <Plug>PerfitysPrimSep


The exact look of a separator line depends on the file type, but you can force
you look you want by assigning specific dictionary variables in your vimrc
file.

For example, the following statement in your vimrc file will cause the
primary separator lines to contain "+-" sequences and to be 79 characters long
and to be surrounded by one empty line when the file type is "sh":

        let g:perfitys_sh_prim_sep = {
                    \ 'indent_level': 0,
                    \ 'post_comment_leader_space': " ",
                    \ 'repeating_sequence': "+-",
                    \ 'length': 79,
                    \ 'pre_comment_trailer_space': " ",
                    \ 'empty_lines_above': 1,
                    \ 'empty_lines_below': 1,
                    \ }




You can force the same look for primary separators in all the file types by
assigning a similar dictionary to g:perfitys_common_prim_sep in your vimrc
file:

        let g:perfitys_common_prim_sep = {
                    \ 'indent_level': 0,
                    \ 'post_comment_leader_space': " ",
                    \ 'repeating_sequence': "+-",
                    \ 'length': 79,
                    \ 'pre_comment_trailer_space': " ",
                    \ 'empty_lines_above': 1,
                    \ 'empty_lines_below': 1,
                    \ }


----------------------------------------------
5.2. Secondary separator

Secondary separator lines are similar to primary separator lines, but they can
have there own look.

A secondary separator line can be inserted using the :SecondSep command, or
using the Plugin | Perfitys menu.

The key mapping is: <Leader>S

You can change this mapping (say to <Leader>ZZ) by adding the following line
to your vimrc file:

        map <Leader>ZZ <Plug>PerfitysSecondSep




You can force the look for secondary separators the same way you can for a
primary separator, by assigning specific dictionary variables in your vimrc
file:

        let g:perfitys_sh_second_sep = {
                    \ 'indent_level': 2,
                    \ 'post_comment_leader_space': " ",
                    \ 'repeating_sequence': "+-",
                    \ 'length': 59,
                    \ 'pre_comment_trailer_space': " ",
                    \ 'empty_lines_above': 1,
                    \ 'empty_lines_below': 1,
                    \ }


to apply the look to files of type "sh" only, or

        let g:perfitys_common_prim_sep = {
                    \ 'indent_level': 2,
                    \ 'post_comment_leader_space': " ",
                    \ 'repeating_sequence': "+-",
                    \ 'length': 59,
                    \ 'pre_comment_trailer_space': " ",
                    \ 'empty_lines_above': 1,
                    \ 'empty_lines_below': 1,
                    \ }


to apply the look to all file types.
